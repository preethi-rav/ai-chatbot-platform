AI Chatbot Platform – Learning POC
Overview

This is a personal learning project created to explore and prototype an AI chatbot use case. The goal of this project is to test specific logic and workflows while setting up a reproducible local development environment. It serves as a hands-on proof of concept for understanding AI application development and testing practices.

Purpose

This project was built purely for skill development and experimentation. It does not replicate or represent any company-owned systems or workflows. The focus is on learning environment setup, logic validation, and development best practices.

Features

Local development environment setup for testing chatbot logic

Dependency and configuration management

Simple proof-of-concept workflows to validate chatbot use cases

Reproducible setup for consistent testing

Setup Instructions
1. Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Application
python app.py


(Update the run command based on your project’s entry file)

Usage

This project is intended for:

Experimenting with chatbot logic

Testing isolated AI use cases

Learning development workflows

Prototyping integrations before moving to cloud platforms

Tools & Technologies

Python

Open-source libraries for AI/chatbot prototyping

Virtual environment & dependency management

(No cloud services or enterprise platforms are directly used in this POC.)

Disclaimer

This project is a personal educational exercise. All code and workflows are created independently for learning purposes and do not reflect or replicate any proprietary systems, business logic, or client data.

Future Enhancements

Integrate cloud services such as Azure OpenAI or Azure App Services

Add persistent storage for chatbot sessions

Expand chatbot use-case logic and testing coverage

Implement CI/CD pipelines
